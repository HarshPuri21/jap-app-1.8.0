"""One-time merge: fold the JLPT-graded kanji_dataset_final.json (N5-N1)
into the app's existing assets/data/kanji.json.

Implements the three-way merge described in kanji_integration_prompt.md:
  - kanji only in the OLD file            -> kept byte-for-byte, jlpt_level
                                              added if a match exists anywhere
                                              in the new dataset.
  - kanji only in the NEW dataset         -> fresh entry built from the
                                              field-mapping rules below.
  - kanji in BOTH                         -> onyomi/kunyomi/jlpt_level are
                                              upgraded from the new dataset;
                                              meaning, common_words, breakdown
                                              and is_radical are left exactly
                                              as they already were.

Character identity (the `kanji` string) is never changed, removed, or
reordered for any pre-existing entry -- that string is ProgressService's SRS
key (`'kanji:$kanji'`), so preserving it exactly is what keeps every user's
review history valid. Existing entries keep their original list position;
new entries are appended after them.

Usage:
    python3 tool/merge_kanji_dataset.py

Reads:
    assets/data/kanji.json                      (existing, 536 entries)
    <new dataset path below>                     (source of truth for JLPT)
    assets/data/radicals.json                    (read-only, for is_radical)
Writes:
    assets/data/kanji.json                       (overwritten, merged)
    tool/merge_kanji_dataset.log.json            (per-kanji change log)

# across the WHOLE list before taking the first 3, rather than filtering
# only the naive first three -- see merge_kanji_dataset.md notes in the
